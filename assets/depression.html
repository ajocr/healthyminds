	<h1>Major Depressive Disorder </h1> 
	<p>Commonly termed as depression, this is a common yet grave mood disorder
	that should not take lightly. It negatively affects people in their 
	day-to-day activities as it feels like one is continuously carrying a heavy
 	burden. According to the World Health Organisation, more than 264 million 
	people of all ages suffer from this disorder. While this is more common 
	amongst women, teens and young adults, please note that anyone is susceptible 
	to the illness and hence, you are not alone! </p>
	<p> As stated earlier, MDD usually poses as a daily challenge to those who have it. These challenges can become so unbearable that people choose to end their lives to end their suffering. </p>

	<p style="font-size: 1.250em"> However, everybody is different. </p>

<p>The intensity of the health condition on each person varies. Hence, it is paramount that one is aware and professionally diagnosed for treatment to begin as soon as possible. </p>

<h2> Types of MDD </h2>
<p>Yes, there are types of depression, and you must be in the know. Each type has its set of symptoms; however, both can be chronic and liable to terrible relapses, especially when untreated. </p>

<p style="font-size: 1.250em"> Even though you will be knowledgeable in a second, self-diagnosis is not advised as it can lead to more dangerous outcomes. </p>

<h4> Helpful Definitions </h4>
<ol>
	<li><i>Depressive episodes</i> â€“<br>  The individual goes into the typically depressed mood. There is a sense of reduced energy and loss of interest and excitement. This usually results in relative inactivity for <b>at least two weeks</b>. </li>
	<li><i>Manic episodes</i>-<br>  Contrary to depressive episodes, when experiencing the manic episode, the individual experiences a sense of inflated self-esteem, pressure of speech, and tends to be overly excited and testy. This usually results in a decreased need for sleep. </li>
</ol>

<p>Now to the types,</p>
